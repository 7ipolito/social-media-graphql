### Frontend
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows us to create reusable UI components.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-rendered applications and static sites, providing optimized performance and development experience.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript, offering static type-checking and the latest ECMAScript features.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center` and more to style your websites without leaving your HTML.
- **Apollo Client**: A powerful state management library for interacting with GraphQL APIs and managing local data in a React application.
- **NextUI**: A modern React UI library offering customizable and pre-designed components for quick and efficient development.
- **Framer Motion**: A library for creating advanced animations and transitions in React with a simple and declarative API.
- **Clerk**: A comprehensive authentication and user management solution for modern web applications.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center` and more to style your websites without leaving your HTML.


### Backend

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications.
- **GraphQL**: A query language and runtime that simplifies API development with strongly typed schemas.
- **PrismaORM**: Prisma ORM is an open-source next-generation ORM.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database designed for high performance, scalability, and flexibility.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM for MongoDB, providing schema-based solutions for modeling application data.
- **Jest**: A testing framework designed for creating unit and integration tests with simplicity and speed.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.

## Installation


Before you start, ensure you have `node` and `npm` installed on your machine. 

1. **Clone the repository**:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/7ipolito/social-media-graphql.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repository**:

   ```bash
   cd social-media-graphql
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:

   - For install both dependecies run:
   
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   - To inicialize prisma run:
   
   ```bash
   cd backend && npx run prisma generate
   ```


## Running the Application

- **To run the frontend**:

  ```bash
  npm run start-frontend
  ```

  This starts the React application on `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port).

- **To run the backend**:

  ```bash
  npm run start-backend
  ```

  This initializes the Express server, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.

- **To run both simultaneously**:

  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

  This will invoke `concurrently` to start both the front and back ends.

Ensure that the frontend and backend are configured to run on separate ports to avoid conflicts.

## Conclusion
This project provided me with a lot of knowledge about using Clerk, sparked my creativity, and gave me the opportunity to improve my coding style in a much more efficient way compared to the past.
